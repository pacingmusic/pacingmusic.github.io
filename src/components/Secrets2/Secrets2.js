                              A few months ago I asked strangers on the internet to anonymously send me their deepest insecurities to be featured in the music video for my song "Who has ADHD now lol." 
                              </p>
                            <p>
                              I am so grateful to every single person who sent one. It made me sad to hear how mean people can be to themselves, but itâ€™s also comforting to know that I am not alone. I hope that when you see the video, it makes you feel like you are not alone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              You can still submit your insecurities below, and I read every single one. I might even do another video with them or write songs using them.
                            </p>
